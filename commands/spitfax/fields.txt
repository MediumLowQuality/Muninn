Don't use slurs or engage in racism, sexism, or other \"-isms\" that are cruel to other users. This may extend to behavior that takes place outside of the server, as well (in other words, sending a user hateful private messages or harassing them on another server may result in your removal from this server). General chat should not be used for extended discussion of topics such as religion, politics, or your sex life. If moderators ask you to stop a conversation, stop. We understand that you have opinions, but extended discussions of these topics usually devolve into unpleasantness for everyone involved. Ultimately, this is a discord about Skyrim mods, and we'd like to keep it that way.","inline":false}],"author":{"name":"Simon Makes Mods","iconURL":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/icons/622502918498811907/8ca89c5c2d0d90f56d3f0f60ba75601f.png?size=1024"},"footer":{"text":"Moderator decisions are final."}}```
